About
=====

Jumpcut is an application that provides "clipboard buffering" -- that is, access to text that you've cut or copied, even if you've subsequently cut or copied something else. The goal of Jumpcut's interface is to provide quick, natural, intuitive access to your clipboard's history.

Two main differences from the [original code][1]:

1. Ignores temporary changes made to the clipboard by TextExpander.

2. Incorporates stylistic improvements from [drdrang's fork][2].
